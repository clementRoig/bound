Horror :
- Disempowerement : vulnerable, isolation, mouvement, hostile, nowhere to go,
breached -> die, trespassing on hostile ground, place = death, low light,
setting itself can disempower (object do not behave in usual ways),
macro/micro level
- Residual dread : what happened, asylum, execution grounds, disquiet past,
place as monster
